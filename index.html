				<td> I'm teaching kids (7 to 15 years old) basics of programming in environments like Scratch,
					App Inventor, Python, C#. This work helped me develop my teaching skills, patience, and understanding

				<td> DTP - Digital Technology Poland </td>
				<td> I was recruited on lecture about Graph Theory organized by DTP. For the first two months, I collaborated with a team of mathematicians from a local university to develop a novel algorithm for detecting patterns in binary signals using R and Python. Later I joined a development team, where I received training in Git, CSS, basic C#, Golang, Docker, and Azure Service. During the development of a Python-based web application, which was part of a product designed to maintain industrial machines, we utilized various tools such as Azure Boards, Azure Repos, and Azure Pipelines in Azure DevOps to manage our work. The web application was built with Python and Flask, hosted on Azure App Service, and used Azure SQL for the database. My primary responsibilities included writing REST API endpoints, creating functional tests using the Pytest library, refactoring legacy code, collaborating with the frontend team, and researching potential solutions for the project and writing simple YAML pipelines to automate our  testing and deployment.
